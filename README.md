# MtAkoom 

My First full-formed Unity game, 

embedded into a Ruby and Sinatra app ( the quickest solution I could think up)

Hosted on a free and quick service, Heroku.


Although I couldn't find any examples of what I intended to do with Ruby, Sinatra, and Unity. 

I was sure that it shouldn't be all that difficult to figure it out. :relieved:


*Game should work on FireFox, and Safari and on both Windows and Mac*


*Unity Player will not work in Chrome* 

*I've heard, although i could not test it out myself that Linux machine's also have trouble with the Unity Player*
